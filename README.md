# Besen Charger NodeJS
I am attempting to reverse engineer the communication between the EVSE Master mobile app and my Besen Car Charger.

I am using the Android APK as a reference, which I decompiled. This will serve as a reference for the SDK I am trying to put together, so this charger can be connected to Home Assistant, using [QuantumHub](https://quantumhub.app).
